# TODOs

## Medium priority
- Make sure that all blocks work with all (faulty) user input (message = message ? message.toString() : '')

## Low priority
- Fix bad window resizing behaviour
- Write JSDoc for all JS files
- During long animations, pressing pause should immediately disable the pause button
- Remove "syntax error" warning when loading bad algorithm XML
- Simplify "getAligned.." functions
- Merge solution paths when calculating maze solutions
- Change ORDER_NONE and ORDER_ATOMIC to the correct strength (only needed if the generated code is displayed, in order to reduce the number of useless parentheses)
- Handle exceptions during execution instead of simply ignoring them in EnhancedIntepreter

## Ideas
- Add a finish sound?
- Block help URLs?
- Put code onto Github?
