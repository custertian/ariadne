Ariadne is a learning environment for teaching maze algorithms. It was written in 2015 by Stefan Melbinger as part of his master thesi.

## Requirements:
- NodeJS 0.12.3
- npm 2.9.1 *)

*) It seems as if higher versions of npm do not compile correctly. This might be fixed in newer versions.

## Compilation:
1. Install external packages by running `npm install`.
2. Compile the project with either `gulp` or `gulp --dev` for testing purposes.
3. Zip afterwards using `gulp zip`.
